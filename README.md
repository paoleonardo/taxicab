## Introduction

Taxicab numbers arise from a famous anecdote involving mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. He famously stated that 1729 is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways. This project explores these numbers and provides tools for their prime factorization.

In this repository, you will find code and resources to calculate taxicab numbers and their prime factors. 

## What are Taxicab Numbers?

Taxicab numbers, denoted as T(n), represent the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in n distinct ways. The first few taxicab numbers are:

- T(1) = 1
- T(2) = 8
- T(3) = 27
- T(4) = 64
- T(5) = 125
- T(6) = 216
- T(7) = 729
- T(8) = 1729
- T(9) = 4104
- T(10) = 13832

These numbers hold a special place in number theory and have applications in various mathematical fields.

## Prime Factor Decomposition

Understanding the prime factorization of taxicab numbers adds another layer of insight. Each taxicab number can be expressed as a product of prime numbers. For example:

- T(2) = 8 = 2¬≥
- T(3) = 27 = 3¬≥
- T(4) = 64 = 2‚Å∂

This project provides functions to calculate the prime factorization of each taxicab number, enabling deeper analysis and understanding.

# Create an instance of Taxicab
taxicab = Taxicab()

# Get the first 10 taxicab numbers
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(f"T({i}) = {taxicab.get_taxicab_number(i)}")
    print(f"Prime Factors of T({i}): {taxicab.get_prime_factors(i)}")
```
